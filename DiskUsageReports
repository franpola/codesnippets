## Listing files ordered by size

The starting point is the cmdlet Get-ChildItem 
that allows you to list files and directories. 
Get-ChildItem alone can't find the largest files. Thus, you have to filter its output to extract the wanted properties.

gci -r| sort -descending -property length | select -first 10 name, length

## Displaying file sizes in GB

gci -r|sort -descending -property length | 
select -first 10 name, @{Name="Gigabytes";Expression={[Math]::round($_.length / 1GB, 2)}}
